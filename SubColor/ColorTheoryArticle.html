  <h1>Color Theory</h1>
  <p>The essential thing to accomplish with color theory when it comes to web design is that color for text and the background it rests on must be sufficiently different in contrast that the text is easily legible</p>
  <p>A bad example of color theory I had in mind to display was the website for the Ritz Carlton for Pentagon city which had baby blue text on a sky blue background and was comparable to trying to spot invisible ink. It was so bad in fact that the website got changed before I got a screenshot of how it looked.</p>
  <p>A good example of color theory is <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20198170511&gclid=CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwCyfVdyMiCtRBsgVThVV7ZoddGAv0KwAt7MZY09LdKqFqxuhDCNh_xoCiHMQAvD_BwE">I Buy Power’s website</a> which makes a use of a good variety of colors to drag a users attention to different focus points on the screen. Its uses its bold reds to bring attention to what users that want to get in and out would want to see right away. Like the ability to head straight to their PC builder.
     Discounts on items. It also categorizes different sections with different colors. This is a wonderful type of color theory that actively uses a wide variety of colors.</p>

  <p>Another good example is Friendship place which uses a rather minimal color palette that uses Blue some accents of green and the occasional red to grab attention. Its simple but very effective in its design.</p>

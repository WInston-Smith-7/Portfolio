      <h2>Writeup</h2>
      <h3>Project goal</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project was to restore this photo by healing away the damage to the photograph. Removing dust, scratches, flakes creases, and punctures.</p>
      <h3>Assets</h3>
      <p>A single base photo named “JE_DT.PNG"</p>
      <h3>The process</h3>
      <p>I created a healing layer above the base image and went to clear away the white flecks using the spot 
        healing brush tool. I then took care of what seemed to be a puncture in the photo on Epstein’s vest 
        that was too large for the spot healing. I used the healing brush tool and selected a nearby spot to 
        place over the damaged part. I then worked on the creases on the photo with the spot healing in 
        some parts and clone brush in other parts. I then darkened the photo to tone down the brightness of 
        the flash.</p>
      <h3>Difficulties</h3>
      <p>I largely feel the photo restoration is complete meets the goals I set out for it and I had little to no difficulty accomplishing it.</p>

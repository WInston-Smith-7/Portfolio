    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
    <p>My goal was to create a magazine cover similar in style to "People" magazine.</p>
    <h3>Assets</h3>
    <p>The assets I used were acquired	 from pexels. The main picture being pexels-kampus-8711879 
      and the secondary picture being pexels-daniel-duarte-270529097-15921165 </p>
    <h3>The process</h3>
    <p>After deciding on the magazine cover task I decided on a type of magazine I would like to make.
I decided a magazine about jetsports racing would be a good fit. I then looked for good free commercial use photos on Pexels. I then took a piece of paper and a clipboard and manually sketched out a draft of how things would be organized aided by some “People” magazines I have collected for reference.</p>
    <p>After that I opened up photo-shop and inserted guides to help me draft up how a layout would look.
       I then inserted different photos I collected as options for the project to decide which one would fit best. 
       After deciding on a photo I named it.</p>
    <p>I added a woman on a Jet-ski to the photo, turned the image into a smart object, preformed the remove background option, selected a color range to remove the ocean background between her hair.
    I then touched up the text hook for the main article giving it a drop shadow
    I after that worked on the side story and its hook giving it a more vibrant theme and drop shadows.</p>
    <h3>Difficulties</h3>
    <p>I struggled with getting some of the color of the sea between thin strands of hair despite going into color select mode, and other select modes like brush select, lasso select, and magnetic select</p>

    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
    <p>I started off by looking of advertisement resolution sizes for different social media campaigns, I assessed the most effective goal of the campaign would be to bring attention to specific documents or video that based on supporting evidence do exist but the public does not have access to and to explore different designs to see which ones got the best response.</p>
    <h3>Assets</h3>
    <p>I used the following assets jail_2, Ghislaine_Maxwell_MDC_mug_shot, Maxwell_BOP_Data, Pam_Bondi_Oval, and Restored_JE_DT.</p>
    <h3>The process</h3>
    <p>I broke the project into two segments ads for portrait social media posts and square social media posts.
For the portrait posts I started by selecting two photos for reference. I then selected information I found important to bring attention to. I placed the images. I chose large heavy weight sans serif typefaces. To provide effects I duplicated the text below the original and moved it below and to the right to give it a drop shadow effect. I then did another layer on top of that text that used the masking tool and a brush to give it a pattern. With some other text I made many duplicates that were only the outline descending in space and opacity. I then at the bottom put a quote with white text and a black background.</p>
    <p>For the 1080p squares I tried different styles. I used the selection box tool to fill the top half of a square and then use the hotkey alt+backspace to fill it with black. I then inverted the selection to fill the bottom half with a different color. I then pasted a photo in the top half, then I gave it text in the lower half and changed the color of focus points. Finally I gave that text a drop shadow.
I then worked on another ad that was comprised of a variety of fonts with different tilts and color choices for a rough and attention grabbing attitude.
For my final image I place a photo drag a black rectangle partially over it and apply a gradient in a mask over it to have its opacity slowly fade. I added text detailing the image. I then added body text with a grey background and a yellow sidebar.

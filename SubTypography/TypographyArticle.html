    <h2>Bad website example.</h2>
    <p>The Paizo store browsing section <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/rulebooks/core">found here</a>.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Paizo_Website.png" class="" alt="The Paizo website">
    <p>Okay I think the first question to ask when looking at the Paizo storefront is “Where do I even start?” All of the text for the page outside of the header/navigation bar is seemingly a single typeface with very little variation in weight and size. The headers for different sections are only bold and a slightly higher font size. The leading between lines in the same segment is seemingly the same across the board even in item descriptions. Overall there is no real sense of hierarchy thats easily established. Somebody going to this site that is trying to get a gift for somebody would have trouble finding what to get for somebody with a wishlist let alone without one. Also it is completely devoid of style and personality.</p>
    <h2>Good website example</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://morkborg.com/content/">MORK BORG offical website</a></p>
    <img src="../Images/BORG_Website.png" class="" alt="The MORK BORG website">
    <p> Chefs kiss to start off with it has a justified section header at the top to let you know what section you’re on. It uses a variety of typefaces each accomplishing their own goal. The title of a section is a large heavy weight sans serif font that calls the reader’s attention. The body text is a very readable monospace sans serif typeface that is easily parsed on digital screens. The headers for subsections are stylized and convey part of the personality of the brand. It also makes effective use of text decoration with underlines and styles with italics for the note section.</p>
